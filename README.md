## 🎮 What is GoblinChess?

GoblinChess is an innovative chess variant that introduces magical elements to the classic game. Players not only move pieces according to traditional chess rules but can also play spell cards to enchant pieces, manipulate the board, and create strategic advantages.

### Key Features

- **Traditional Chess Foundation**: Standard chess pieces (King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn) with familiar movement patterns
- **Spell Card System**: 10 spell cards that can alter gameplay dynamics
- **Turn-Based Structure**: Each player rotation consists of 3 phases: Card → Move → Neutral
- **Multiple Game Modes**: Classic and Chaotic variants with different time controls
- **ELO Rating System**: Competitive ranking system for players
- **Modern Chess Rules**: Supports En passant, repetition draw (3x), stalemate and everything you'd expect from competitive chess
- **Replay System**: Full game reconstruction from event logs
- **Decentralized**: Fully on-chain. Nothing off-chain

## 🃏 Spell Cards

### Enchantments
- **🐸 Frog**: Transform a piece temporarily, altering its movement capabilities
- **🗿 Turn to Stone**: Petrify a piece, making it immobile for several turns
- **🧪 Potion**: Enhance a piece with special abilities
- **⚔️ Knighted**: Grant knight-like movement to any piece
- **🦘 Jump**: Allow a piece to leap over obstacles

### Board Manipulation
- **🔄 Switch Place**: Swap positions of two pieces instantly
- **🧱 Wall**: Create barriers on the board to block movement
- **🌀 Portal**: Create magical gateways for piece teleportation

### Delayed Spells
- **💀 Resurrect**: Bring back a captured piece (delayed effect)
- **⏳ Double Move**: Make two moves in a single turn

## 🎯 Game Modes

### Classic Mode
- Traditional chess emphasis on few random events and a lot of strategy. 

### Chaotic Mode
- More unpredictable gameplay, since the result of every attack is determined by rolling dice. Primarily for kids or if you want to beat someone above your rating. 

## 🏗️ Architecture

This is a "dApp" and it is built using **Rell**, Chromia's domain-specific language for blockchain development. The archtecture is based on the entity-relationship concept (from relational databases). Here are some core conepts:

### Core Modules
- **Game Management**: Player registration, game creation, lobby system.
- **Turn System**: Turn progression with card/move/neutral phases.
- **Piece Logic**: Traditional chess piece behavior and movement validation, with extra rules for enchanted pieces.
- **Card System**: Spell casting mechanics and effect resolution.
- **Board State**: Keeping the board in memory during an operation is usually the most performant alternative. We use the `board_positions_all` struct to pass this information around.
- **Check/Mate Detection**: Chess rule validation expanding on the traditional ones, since the cards (especially portals) effect the checkmate calculation.
- **Event System**: Game event logging and replay functionality. Old games can be analyzed.



## 🚀 Developer Getting Started
You can try out this code by cloning the repo and and start a Chromia node on your local computer.

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL.
- Chromia blockchain environment, but only the `CHR` tool is needed.
- An editor with a Rell plugin is nice (Rell version 0.14.2 or higher), unless you like to read code in black-n-white?

### Installation
For how to setup your environment you can visit https://chromia.com.
You can also watch my videos explaining how I did it for this game: https://www.youtube.com/@GoblinChess_Olle

### Playing the Game

1. **Register as a Player**: Create your player profile with a unique username
2. **Join Lobby or Create Challenge**: Find opponents through the lobby system or direct challenges
3. **Play**: Alternate between playing spell cards and moving pieces
4. **Win Conditions**: Achieve checkmate, stalemate, or timeout victory

## 🔧 Operations
To get a feel for the API, we here describe the most common operations. A Chromia operation is something that updates the blockchain, and will therefore take some time (a fraction of a second) before the next block is built and the new data is visible.

### Player Operations
- `create_player(name)` - Register a new player
- `enter_lobby(name, game_type)` - Join matchmaking lobby, looking for someone within your rating range to play the given type of game.
- `create_challenge(opponent, game_type)` - Challenge specific player on a specific type of game

### Begin Game Operations
- `create_game_via_lobby(opponent, game_type)` - Start game from lobby
- `create_game_accept_challenge(challenge_id)` - Accept a challenge

### Running Game Operations
- `play_card(game_id, card_data, picks)` - Cast a spell card
- `move_peaceful/move_attack(game_id, move_data)` - Make chess moves
- `skip_neutral_move(game_id)` - Skip neutral phase. This needed to be forward compatible with version 2.0.

## 🔧 Queries 
Chromia makes a clear distinctions between operations and queries, where the latter won't update the blockchain, and will therefore return immediately.

### Query Operations
- `get_player_by_name(player_name)` - Get the player's pubkey from the name, if found
- `in_game(player_pubkey)` - Retrieve the current game for the player, if any
- `find_challenge(player_pubkey, timestamp)` - Returns a not-too-old challenge for the player, if any.



## 🛠️ Development

### For Client Developers
This backend provides a complete API for building GoblinChess clients. The game state is fully deterministic and can be reconstructed from blockchain data. Being on a blockchain means that the data belongs to everyone and nobody, it's yours if you want to.

### For Rell Learners
This codebase serves as a tutorial for:
- Complex entity relationships in Rell
- State management in blockchain applications
- Game logic implementation
- Event-driven architecture
- Query optimization and how to reduce load on the database/blockchain.

There are plenty of comments around the code, partly because Olle needs it, but also to make this one big tutorial.

## 📚 Technical Documentation
### Entity Relationship diagram
Chromia is unique among blockchain platforms since it builds on database tables, called "entities". There are also "structs", and "enums" which work just like in other programming languages. This is the ER-diagram for this game for example. 

![Entity Relationship Diagram](doc/img/rell_er.png)

### Turn Structure
Each player rotation consists of three turns:
1. **Card Turn**: Play a spell card (optional)
2. **Move Turn**: Make a chess move
3. **Neutral Turn**: Reserved for future neutral piece mechanics OR a double move.

There is a state machine validating that the progression from one turn to the next follows our rules called `verify_old_turn_type_new_turn_type()`:

[View turn validation logic →](src/turn/function_validation.rell)

### Randomness Handling
Handling random numbers is hard on the blockchain, since everything we save becomes public info. In this game we simply accept any random number from the client, but in the very end of the game we will verify all the sent random numbers in one go, by generating them just like the client did, using the client's seed. This works since both clients are required to provide their seeds at the end of the game, and if a player just shuts down their client they will lose. Had we stored the seeds early in the game, a player might try to fetch the opponent's seed and this way be able to generate the opponent's cards (which are supposed to be secret). This pic illustrates the seed validation process:  

![Game End Flow](doc/img/rell_game_over_flow.png)

### Main Menu
The Main Menu of the game client uses this flow, shown in the picture below. The red arrows can be ignored, since they only become relevant if there is an unexpected error happening on the node. Note that wherever we are - as long as we have "gone online" - we can always accept an incoming challenge, this way beginning a new game. 

![Game End Flow](doc/img/main_menu_state_machine.png)

To create a game is easy, but waiting for other players to accept an invitation means we need to do polling. This is because a blockchain is ignorant about the world outside, and cannot initiate contacts from server to client. Especially challenges are tricky, since both the player creating the challenge, and the player about to be challenged are polling for news at the same time. The picture below shows an example of a successful challenge: 

![Game End Flow](doc/img/rell_challenge_logic_happy_path.png)

The process is similar for the Lobby: 

![Game End Flow](doc/img/rell_lobby_logic_happy_path.png)

### Modules
We structure our Rell code into modules, and the idea is to encapsulate logic and keep the dependencies between modules to a minimum. In this game the module structure looks like this:

![Game End Flow](doc/img/rell_modules.png)

The "light modules" don't have any dependencies to entities, and are fast/easy to test automatically. The "heavy modules" likely require a full game to be tested properly. 

### Automatic Testing
The code has one big test that runs a complete game, from the first move to the inevitable checkmate, where we try to insert as many strange situations as possible:

## 🤝 Build and Fork

You are free to implemenent a new game client, fork this code and/or fork the blockchain. Should this become a popular game, having the data open from get-go will prevent the original developer (me) from raising prices or whatever evil things I might do in the future. Keeping everything in the open is a solid strategy.

If you find a bug/security hole, please create a pull request.

### QnA

## Tokens?
Yes this is a blockchain, but there are no tokens in this game. The standard client can be bought for a few bucks, that is the only income-generating part of the project.

## Why Chromia?
Chromia is a great platform for developing software, no matter if you are using tokens or not. The principle is openness. Open source, open data.
