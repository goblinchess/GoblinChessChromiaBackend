Bug in double move.

Tested
        TURN_TO_STONE,  

        //--  Enchant change--
        POTION, 
        KNIGHTED,  // Promote with new movements

        //--  This-turn-only change--
        SWITCH_PLACE, // Same as "Fly". Could perhaps be solved by two smoke clouds?
        FROG, 

        //--  Immediate Spell effecting the entire board --
        WALL, // TODO: Remove "summon" 
        PORTAL,

        //--  Delayed Spell --
        RESURRECT, // Resurrect next killed Enemy 
        JUMP, 
Not tested:
        DOUBLE_MOVE,

TODO: Remove the damage from history in classical mode.
TODO: Should we remove the option of attacking obstacles in classical mode (we don't allow anyone to survive).

TODO: Sholud show the opponents spell in the top corner, like in Local.

TODO: Draw the game on 1) repetition 2) lack of mating material.

- We had White/Black in cleartext for My/Opp in the Board._reportXAction() for
  portal??
  This is now replaced, but must be tested.

a) Test time-out of old ongoing games.
b) Test time_left param.

 TODO Client: 
-------------
- Impl RESIGN button

- Call the "fetch data" method for moves and cards.

- Should we send "is_knighted" and "is_enchanted_jumper" on every call? Is it perhaps too hard to find this info?

- Create a C# Chromia client.

- Use Timeout and put clock on the chess scene.
 

Client Done: 



 TODO Node: 
-------------
 
 2. Finish the game when mate

 4. Use Luck

 6. Look in [move] entity before allowing castle.


Node DONE:

 Videos
-------------
 Make an event performance video!
 (Main Idea is to explain that making one SQL-call to fetch all events for a turn is the trick)
