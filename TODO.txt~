Bug: When we in classic mode attack a wall, causing an error, the other player won't get the error ending.


Fix timeout ending for Local games/Bot.

TODO: Remove the damage from history in classical mode.
TODO: Should we remove the option of attacking obstacles in classical mode (we don't allow anyone to survive).

TODO: Draw the game on 1) repetition 2) lack of mating material.

a) Test time-out of old ongoing games.
b) Test time_left param.

 TODO Client: 
-------------
- Impl RESIGN button

- Use Timeout and put clock on the chess scene.
 

Client Done: 





 TODO Node: 
-------------
 
 4. Use Luck

 6. Look in [move] entity before allowing castle.


Node DONE:
In classic mode we cannot attack obstacles, since stones usually survive, and we don't allow half-measures. 


 Videos
-------------
 Make an event performance video!
 (Main Idea is to explain that making one SQL-call to fetch all events for a turn is the trick)
