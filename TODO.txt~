Finish IM calc, on frontend too.


TODO: Remove the damage from history in classical mode.
TODO: Should we remove the option of attacking obstacles in classical mode (we don't allow anyone to survive).

TODO: Draw the game on 1) repetition 2) lack of mating material.

- We had White/Black in cleartext for My/Opp in the Board._reportXAction() for
  portal??
  This is now replaced, but must be tested.

a) Test time-out of old ongoing games.
b) Test time_left param.

 TODO Client: 
-------------
- Impl RESIGN button

- Call the "fetch data" method for moves and cards.

- Should we send "is_knighted" and "is_enchanted_jumper" on every call? Is it perhaps too hard to find this info?

- Create a C# Chromia client.

- Use Timeout and put clock on the chess scene.
 

Client Done: 



 TODO Node: 
-------------
 
 2. Finish the game when mate

 4. Use Luck

 6. Look in [move] entity before allowing castle.


Node DONE:

1. Adding IM as check_data flag. 2. Calculate IM after a successful attack. 3. Returning a new game_end_data struct when
fetching the opp rotation. 

 Videos
-------------
 Make an event performance video!
 (Main Idea is to explain that making one SQL-call to fetch all events for a turn is the trick)
